# Versioned Go Prototype (vgo)

This repository holds a prototype of what the go command
might look like with integrated support for package versioning.

See [research.swtch.com/vgo](https://research.swtch.com/vgo)
for documents about the design.

## Download/Install

Use `go get -u golang.org/x/vgo`.

You can also manually
git clone the repository to `$GOPATH/src/golang.org/x/vgo`.

## Report Issues / Send Patches

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

This is still a very early prototype.
You are likely to run into bugs.
Please file bugs in the main Go issue tracker,
[golang.org/issue](https://golang.org/issue),
and put the prefix `x/vgo:` in the issue title.

Thank you.
